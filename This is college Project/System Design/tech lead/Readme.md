# 🧠 TECH LEAD – COMPLETE ROLE-BASED SYLLABUS

## 🎯 What is a Tech Lead?

> A Tech Lead is responsible for **system design, technical decisions, code quality, scalability, and mentoring the team**.

You are no longer judged only by your code —
you are judged by **how well the system and the team perform**.
