# 🏗️ SOFTWARE ARCHITECT – COMPLETE SYLLABUS

## 🎯 What is a Software Architect?

> A Software Architect is responsible for **designing the entire system**, making technology decisions, ensuring **scalability, security, reliability, and long-term maintainability**.

You are not just writing code anymore —
you are **designing the blueprint of the system**.
