Perfect 👍
Below are **LLD (Low-Level Design) interview questions**, arranged **from basic → advanced**, exactly the kind asked for **Senior / SDE-2 level backend engineers**.
No theory dump — **real design thinking questions**.

---

# 🔹 BASIC LLD QUESTIONS (Warm-up)

1. What is Low-Level Design (LLD)? How is it different from HLD?
2. When do you create LLD in the development lifecycle?
3. What artifacts are part of LLD?
4. What is the role of UML in LLD?
5. Explain Class Diagram vs Sequence Diagram.
6. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
7. What is cohesion? How is it different from coupling?
8. Why should controllers be thin?
9. What is a DTO? Why not use entity objects directly?
10. How do you decide module boundaries?

---

# 🔹 INTERMEDIATE LLD QUESTIONS (Real Interviews)

11. How do you design a module so that it is easily testable?
12. How do you avoid circular dependencies in LLD?
13. How do you apply SOLID principles in backend services?
14. Explain Dependency Injection with an example.
15. Where should validation logic live: controller or service?
16. How do you design error handling in a large backend system?
17. How do you decide between composition vs inheritance?
18. What is the Repository pattern and why is it useful?
19. How do you design a one-time setup feature (like Super Admin setup)?
20. How do you design role-based access control at LLD level?

---

# 🔹 ADVANCED LLD QUESTIONS (Senior Level)

21. Design the LLD for a login system with JWT + refresh tokens.
22. Design the LLD for a multi-tenant system (workspaces).
23. How would you design audit logging without tightly coupling modules?
24. How would you refactor a tightly coupled module into a loosely coupled one?
25. How do you ensure single responsibility in services?
26. How do you design pagination and filtering in APIs?
27. How do you design a feature that must be executed only once?
28. How do you design retry and idempotency at LLD level?
29. How do you model state transitions in LLD?
30. How do you design a module that supports future extension?

---

# 🔹 UML-BASED LLD QUESTIONS (Very Common)

31. Draw a class diagram for a login feature.
32. Draw a sequence diagram for user registration.
33. Draw an activity diagram for password reset.
34. Convert a code skeleton into UML diagrams.
35. Explain how your UML diagrams map to actual code.

---

# 🔹 CODE-ORIENTED LLD QUESTIONS (Interview Favorite)

36. Given this code, identify LLD problems and refactor it.
37. How would you split this large service into smaller services?
38. Where would you place caching logic in LLD?
39. How do you design configuration management in LLD?
40. How do you design a central error handling mechanism?

---

# 🔹 SCENARIO-BASED LLD QUESTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

41. A feature keeps growing — how do you redesign its LLD?
42. A module becomes slow — what LLD-level changes would you make?
43. Two teams are working on dependent modules — how do you reduce friction?
44. How do you design LLD so that changing DB does not affect business logic?
45. How do you design LLD for better code ownership?

---

# 🔹 ONE-LINE QUESTIONS (Rapid Fire)

46. Can LLD exist without UML?
47. Should LLD change when requirements change?
48. Is LLD language-specific?
49. How detailed should LLD be?
50. Who is responsible for LLD in a team?

---

## 🧠 HOW TO PRACTICE (IMPORTANT)

For **each question**, answer like this:

```
1. Explain in 2–3 lines
2. Give one real project example
3. Mention one design principle
```

Example:

> “I designed LLD using service and repository layers to maintain low coupling and testability.”
