## 🧠 First, What Does a 30 LPA Company Want?

They do **NOT** want:
❌ Someone who only watches tutorials
❌ Someone who only copy-pastes code

They want:
✅ Someone who **understands why things work**
✅ Someone who can **build real systems**
✅ Someone who can **fix problems when things break**

So the goal is:
👉 **Become a problem solver, not just a coder**

---

## 🔍 Two Common Learning Styles

### 1️⃣ “Learn First, Then Do”

This means:

* Watch videos
* Read theory
* Understand concepts
* Then start coding later

📌 Example:
You study **JWT, microservices, caching, databases** for 3 months…
But you **never build a real project**.

### Problem with this:

You *know words*, but you **don’t know how to apply them**.

Like:

> You read about driving a car… but never actually drive 🚗

---

### 2️⃣ “Learn by Doing”

This means:

* Start building immediately
* Follow tutorials
* Copy code
* Make a project quickly

📌 Example:
You build a SaaS app by following YouTube
Login works, dashboard works, API works

### Problem with this:

You **don’t know why** things are written that way.
If something breaks, you are stuck.

Like:

> You can drive only on one road…
> but if there is traffic or damage, you don’t know what to do.

## 🏆 What Actually Works for 30 LPA

You must combine **both**.

### ✅ The Correct Strategy:

```
LEARN → DO → THINK → REBUILD
```

I will explain each word simply.

---

## 🥇 Step 1: LEARN (Understand the Idea)

Before writing code, ask:

* What problem does this solve?
* Why do companies use it?
* What happens if I don’t use it?

📌 Example: Authentication

You learn:

* What is login?
* What is JWT?
* Why we don’t store passwords directly?
* What is security risk?

👉 This gives you **clarity in your brain**

---

## 🥈 Step 2: DO (Build It Yourself)

Now you **implement it in your project**.

* Create login API
* Hash passwords
* Generate JWT
* Protect routes

❗ But:

* Don’t copy blindly
* Type it yourself
* Try to make decisions

👉 Now knowledge becomes **real skill**

---

## 🥉 Step 3: THINK (Analyze Your Own System)

This is where **high salary thinking starts**.

Ask yourself:

* What if 1 million users login?
* What if server goes down?
* Can one user see another company’s data?
* Where can a hacker attack?

📌 Example:
You realize:

* My database will become slow
* My API has no rate limiting
* My SaaS has no tenant isolation

👉 Now you are **thinking like a system designer**

---

## 🏅 Step 4: REBUILD (Improve Like a Senior Engineer)

Now you **redesign your project**:

* Add Redis cache
* Add role-based access
* Separate services
* Improve DB schema
* Add security layers

👉 This is what **real engineers do in companies**

---

## 🧪 Simple Life Example

### ❌ Only “Learn First”

You read:

> “How to swim” book

But never go in water.
You **know theory**, but you **cannot swim**.

---

### ❌ Only “Learn by Doing”

You jump into water without learning.
You may survive once… but you don’t understand:

* How to float
* How to save energy
* How to rescue others

---

### ✅ Correct Way

1. Learn basics of swimming
2. Enter water
3. Notice mistakes
4. Improve technique

That’s exactly:

```
Learn → Do → Think → Rebuild
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Is Important for 30 LPA

Because high-pay interviews ask:

* “Why did you design it this way?”
* “How will this scale?”
* “What happens if DB fails?”
* “How do you secure multi-tenant data?”

If you only:

* **Learn** → you can’t build
* **Do only** → you can’t explain

👉 You need **both**

---

## 🛠 Your Case (You Want SaaS + 30 LPA)

Here is how **YOU** should study:

### 🔹 Phase 1: Learn

Understand:

* Auth (JWT, RBAC)
* Databases
* Caching
* Multi-tenancy
* Security

### 🔹 Phase 2: Do

Build your own:

* SaaS login system
* Organization / tenant system
* Core feature (projects, tasks, etc.)

### 🔹 Phase 3: Think

Ask:

* Will this work for 1M users?
* Can one company see another’s data?
* What if server crashes?

### 🔹 Phase 4: Rebuild

Improve:

* Add Redis
* Add better DB structure
* Add access control
* Improve architecture

---

## 🏆 Final Simple Answer

### ❓ “Learn by doing or learn then do?”

### ✅ Correct answer:

**Neither alone is enough.**

👉 To reach **30 LPA**, you must follow:

```
LEARN → DO → THINK → REBUILD
```

This makes you:
✔ Not just a coder
✔ But a **system engineer**

And **system engineers get high packages**.
